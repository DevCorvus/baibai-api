# Baibai API

A NestJS RESTful API for the [Baibai Client (demo)](https://github.com/DevCorvus/baibai-client) with Passport authentication (JWT), Sequelize (SQLite) and everything fully tested.

> **Baibai** is a demo application where people can post items for sale but also buy those of others (kinda). Pretty much an e-commerce.

You are free to explore and use the code at your convenience. I hope you find it useful and thanks for reading. ❤️

## Development

Another backend learning project in which this time I wanted to implement a new architecture, better designed, more dogmatic and that would speed up development. For this I set my eye on NestJS, a batteries-included framework (based on Typescript) that offers all these features and much more. In practice, the result has been outstanding and I have really enjoyed the development experience, especially because it offers a lot of flexibility despite its strict guidelines and has support for an endless number of common problems that have their respective (and quite comfortable) integration with the framework. I have valued this experience so much that it will surely be my priority option from now on for backend projects in production, be they relatively small, medium or large and of almost any kind.
